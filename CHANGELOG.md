## [Unreleased]

### Prefill / decode telemetry
- **Phase 3 — use-case trace writers + REST/replay shape + CI guard (spec v1.7).**
  Every `TRACE_KEY_ROLE: "assistant"` dict in `application/use_cases/`
  now populates the four new telemetry keys (`ttft_ms`, `decode_ms`,
  `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`) from the returning
  `LLMResponseDTO`. Eleven assistant-role sites covered across
  `run_rlm.py` (8), `run_direct.py` (2 — sync + async branches), and
  the Phase-2 `run_rag.py` site. The server-side `TraceStep` Pydantic
  model, the `/api/traces/{id}` response builder, and the Learn-tab
  replay converter (`trace_to_replay.py`) mirror the six new fields;
  frontend `TraceStep` and `LearnReplayStepMetrics` interfaces get
  matching optional fields. A new CI guard test
  (`tests/test_trace_writers.py`) greps the use-case tree for every
  assistant dict and fails if any is missing the four keys — blocks
  future PRs that add a new assistant-role writer without attending
  to telemetry. ACs: 9, 29.
- **Phase 2 — data model + cache extraction + store migration + RAG two-step trace (spec v1.7).**
  `TraceStep` gains six fields (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`,
  `ttft_ms`, `decode_ms`, `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`) plus a
  `TraceStep.from_dict` classmethod (AC-23). `ExecutionTrace` gains four
  derived properties (`total_prompt_tokens`, `total_completion_tokens`,
  `cache_hit_rate` capped at 1.0, `median_ttft_ms`) — AC-4.
  `LiteLLMAdapter._extract_cache_tokens` handles Anthropic
  (`cache_read_input_tokens` + `cache_creation_input_tokens`) and OpenAI
  (`prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) schemas; returns `(0, 0)` for
  unknown providers — AC-3. Cache counts are now populated on every
  streamed LiteLLM response. Telemetry store gains a migration harness
  keyed on `PRAGMA user_version`: `_SCHEMA_SQL` stays frozen at the v1
  baseline; `_MIGRATIONS` is the single source of truth for post-v1
  schema changes. The v2 block adds the six step columns +
  `runs.outcome_category` (the column is added now; writers wire up in
  Phase 4) — AC-5, AC-20, AC-22. `run_rag.py` now emits a two-entry
  trace: step 0 is `rag_retrieval` (retrieval-side metrics unchanged),
  step 1 is `assistant` with the four new telemetry keys populated from
  the LLM response DTO — AC-13a. Route-layer materialization (AC-13b)
  arrives in Phase 4.
- **Phase 1 — streaming-under-the-hood (spec v1.7).** `LLMPort.
  complete_stream_async` now yields `StreamChunk` events; the terminal
  chunk carries a populated `LLMResponseDTO` with four new fields
  (`ttft_ms`, `decode_ms`, `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`).
  `LiteLLMAdapter.complete()` and `.complete_async()` stream under
  the hood by default so TTFT and decode_ms are measured on every
  call. The legacy `openai` / `anthropic` / `ollama` / `mock`
  adapters migrate to the new `StreamChunk` signature; `ttft_ms` is
  `None` on the three wrappers because their underlying clients have
  no streaming backend. The two in-repo consumers (`run_rlm.py`,
  `run_direct.py`) read `chunk.response` on the final chunk and drop
  the previous approximate-token synthesis. Panic lever:
  `RLMKIT_STREAMED_COMPLETE=0` restores the pre-Phase-1
  non-streaming behavior for the two sync paths (`complete`,
  `complete_async`); the `complete_stream_async` signature change
  is unconditional because Protocol signatures cannot branch on
  env. Cache-token extraction, TraceStep changes, and store
  migration land in Phase 2.

Learn tab V2 — a self-contained surface that teaches the RLM loop
through a scrubbable, step-by-step replay. Shipped in three slices
(V1 → V2a → V2b) across PRs #20, #23, and #24.

### Added
- **Learn tab (V1, PR #20)**: new `/learn` surface with Concepts,
  Cookbook, and Troubleshooting sub-pages. Mode chooser, diagnostics
  strip, and markdown-backed guides for `rlm-concepts`, `rlm-prompt-tuning`,
  `rlm-studio-guide`, and `lessons-from-ai-copilots`.
- **Replay walkthrough widget (V2a, PR #23)**: 6-node SVG diagram,
  play / pause / step / reset controls at 1× / 1.5× / 2× speeds,
  three-pane layout (controls / diagram / step list + detail). Mounts
  on the Concepts page with a bundled demo replay. Advanced details
  tray is folded into the right pane and resets to collapsed on
  step change.
- **Trace-backed replay (V2b, PR #24)**: deep-link from any execution
  to its own walkthrough.
  - `GET /api/replays/{execution_id}` — pure-service converter
    (`src/rlmkit/application/services/trace_to_replay.py`) that turns
    a canonical `TraceResponse` into a `LearnReplay`. Returns a bare
    `LearnReplay` (no wrapper); 404 with the standard error envelope
    when the id is unknown. Omits null optional fields on the wire to
    match bundled replay JSON.
  - `/learn/replay/[executionId]` — SWR-based page that mirrors
    Concepts' loading / error / ready pattern; reuses the shared
    `ReplayWalkthrough` widget exactly (no second renderer).
    Surfaces a truncation banner when `metadata.truncated` fires.
  - Traces row CTA — small outline "Replay in Learn" button per row
    navigates to the new page; keyboard-safe (Enter/Space on the
    button no longer bubbles into the row's open-trace handler).
  - Shared canonical trace loader — fixes the live-execution path
    so both `/api/traces/{id}` and `/api/replays/{id}` see the same
    `inspect | subcall | final | error` action-type enum.
  - Contract refinement: code-less `inspect` steps (the RLM
    controller's "Runtime fingerprint" preamble) are dropped from
    trace-sourced replays rather than rendered as empty code cards.

### Tests
- +5 converter unit tests for the code-less-inspect refinement
  (real-trace fixture + whitespace-only / null / post-skip-subcall
  edges).
- +5 e2e tests for the replay route (unknown id → 404, telemetry
  round-trip, in-memory canonicalization regression guard, failed
  run with `metadata.failed` + folded error, null-omission wire
  shape, bare `LearnReplay` response).
- +34 unit tests for the `trace_to_replay` service across bookends,
  kind inference, metadata, failure handling, truncation, step
  bounds, ids/titles, and final-step folding.
- +8 frontend tests (5 for the page, 3 for the Traces CTA) covering
  loading / error / ready / truncated states and the keyboard /
  mouse stopPropagation contract.

### Fixed
- Failed-run replays now preserve the trace-side failing output in
  `answer.details.output` instead of duplicating the run-level
  error string from `summary`.
- Truncation banner copy now matches the metadata it cites
  ("The full replay would have had N steps" — `originalStepCount`
  is the pre-truncation replay length, not the raw trace step count).

---

Evaluation & Ops — a cluster of features landed in the same window
that together close the "is my RLMKit deployment healthy, and are
my results any good?" feedback loop. Grouped separately from the
Learn tab work because it ships independently.

### Added (Evaluation & Ops)
- **LLM Tuner / Compare matrix** — new `/compare` page backed by
  `POST /api/chat/compare-matrix`. Runs the same query across a
  Provider × Mode grid in parallel, ranks cells by cost, tokens,
  latency, `answer_per_cost`, or `judge_score`. Ephemeral Chat
  Providers are built on the fly from the picked combinations and
  don't persist to Settings. Synchronous endpoint — the UI renders
  once every cell has completed or errored.
- **LLM-as-judge rubric v2.0** — pointwise scoring across five
  dimensions (relevance, correctness, completeness, coherence,
  conciseness, each 1–5) plus a pairwise variant with an explicit
  `a`/`b`/`tie` winner. `overall_score` is the mean of dimensions,
  rounded to 2 decimals, clamped to [1.0, 5.0]. Rubric prompts live
  in `src/rlmkit/prompts/judge_pointwise.yaml` and
  `judge_pairwise.yaml`. Judge provider is configured app-wide via
  `judge_chat_provider_id`. Non-usable outcomes auto-score without
  calling the judge: 1.0 for `budget_exhausted` with ≥50 chars of
  answer, 0.0 for all other failures — keeps `judge_score` sortable
  across a mix of successes and failures without wasting judge
  tokens.
- **Outcome classifier + failure metrics** — every execution is
  classified into one of `success`, `timeout`, `budget_exhausted`,
  `context_overflow`, `general_error`. Non-success outcomes are
  excluded from cost / latency / token aggregations across the
  Dashboard. New endpoint `GET /api/metrics/failures/{session_id}`
  returns failure rate plus breakdowns by category, provider, and
  mode. Dashboard gains a failure chart.
- **Scheduled connection testing** — new global setting
  `connection_test_interval_minutes` (0–1440, 0 disables). A
  background daemon re-tests up to 5 providers in parallel with a
  10-second per-test timeout. A provider flips to `offline` only
  after 2 consecutive failures (flap avoidance); a single manual
  `Test Connection` success flips it back to connected immediately.
  Per-provider audit fields: `last_tested_at`, `last_tested_by`
  (`manual` | `background`), `consecutive_failures`. Settings UI
  surfaces all three.
- **Conversation memory toggle** — `conversation_memory_enabled`
  flag on `ChatProviderConfig`. RLM / RAG / Auto modes bind prior
  turns as a Python variable `history` inside the sandbox REPL
  (byte-capped, model reads on demand — zero token cost when
  unused). Direct / Compare modes deliver history as an in-prompt
  "Previous conversation:" prefix, token-budgeted (default 30% of
  context window). Flip the toggle off for stateless benchmarking.
- **Trace bulk delete** — Gmail-style selection on the Traces page,
  plus single-row delete with confirm dialog. Backend endpoints:
  `DELETE /api/executions/{id}` for single and
  `DELETE /api/executions` to clear a session.
- **LLM-provider UX polish** — Test Connection in the edit form
  (not just the list row), provider logo in the sidebar, fix for
  the model-dropdown not refreshing after a Test Connection that
  invalidated the previous model list.

### Fixed (Evaluation & Ops)
- Stall breaker now accepts plain-text answers once all uploaded
  files have been inspected, even if the model hasn't emitted an
  explicit final-answer JSON action.
- JSON action parser tolerates trailing braces, prose after the
  JSON block, and `<think>…</think>` wrappers — matches how
  reasoning-tuned models actually emit tool calls.
- PDFs ≥ 50 MB no longer fail with a truncation error during
  upload; the size cap was lifted and chunking handles large files
  incrementally.
- Anthropic requests guard against `temperature` + `top_p` being
  sent together (the Anthropic API rejects this combination with
  an empty response). When a profile sets a custom temperature,
  `top_p` is cleared automatically.
- Timeout warnings surface in the UI before the wall-clock cap
  fires, so users see a warning banner rather than silent
  truncation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-28

Cycle 3 (Quality, DevOps & Release) + Cool-down 3.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `ExecutionConfig.default_safe_mode` now defaults to `True` — sandbox restrictions (blocked modules, restricted builtins via RestrictedPython) are active by default. Pass `safe_mode=False` explicitly to opt into unrestricted execution.
- **BREAKING:** `RecursiveController.max_depth` now defaults to `1` (aligned with the RLM paper's evaluated regime). Deeper recursion remains fully supported — pass `max_depth=N` explicitly. Previous default was `5`.

### Added
- CI pipeline: Codecov coverage upload, pip-audit vulnerability scan, Docker sandbox build + smoke-test job
- Coverage gate raised to 80%; omit list scoped to Streamlit-bound files only — pure-Python `ui/data/` and `ui/services/` remain measured
- Pre-commit mypy hook (`uv run mypy src/rlmkit/ --ignore-missing-imports`); ruff scope expanded to all of `src/rlmkit/`
- `execute_async()` on all three sandbox adapters (`LocalSandboxAdapter`, `RestrictedSandboxAdapter`, `DockerSandboxAdapter`) — satisfies `SandboxPort` protocol
- `complete_async()` and `complete_stream_async()` on all legacy LLM adapters (`MockLLMAdapter`, `OpenAIAdapter`, `AnthropicAdapter`, `OllamaAdapter`) — satisfies `LLMPort` protocol; streaming wrappers delegate to `complete_async` via `asyncio.to_thread` to remain non-blocking
- Async API variants: `interact_async()`, `complete_async()` with `api_base` and `timeout` parameters
- Storybook 10 with 27 component stories across 7 components
- Frontend test suite: 175 passing + 21 skipped tests (vitest, Node ≥ 22)
- D1: Unified `interact()` / `interact_async()` API consolidation
- D2: Dashboard charts polished (chart types, color palette, tooltips)
- D3: Frontend cleanup — dead chat components removed, dead API functions removed, error toasts added (`sonner`), Dashboard→Traces deep-link, Traces "Load more" pagination

### Fixed
- Security (CodeQL `py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`): replaced bespoke `_update_env_file()` with `SecretStore` dispatch — OS keyring when available, JSON file (`~/.rlmkit/api_keys.json`, chmod 600) as fallback; startup `_reload_stored_api_keys()` restores persisted keys with correct precedence (real env > SecretStore > legacy `.env`)
- `_create_llm_adapter()` return type narrowed from `object` to `LLMPort`; branch-local variable names fixed to prevent mypy incompatible-assignment errors
- `ExecutionSlot.mode` cast to `Literal["rlm","direct","rag"]` in configuration panel
- Anthropic default model updated to `claude-sonnet-4-6` across `api.py` and `RLMKitClient`
- Local providers (`ollama`, `lmstudio`) now require an explicit `model=` argument; no silent default (avoids "model not found" errors on deployments with different models pulled)
- ESLint `globalIgnores` includes `storybook-static/`

### Known Limitations
- **No timeout enforcement in non-main threads (e.g., Streamlit):** When the REPL environment runs outside the main thread, signal-based timeouts are unavailable and process-based timeouts would break variable persistence. Code execution proceeds without a timeout guard in these contexts. A warning is now logged when this path is taken. Out-of-process sandbox execution is planned for v1.1.0.
