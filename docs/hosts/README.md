# Connecting an LLM to RLMKit

RLMKit treats every LLM as a pluggable backend behind a single adapter (LiteLLM). This page is the landing doc for the `hosts/` subtree: it covers the decision of *which* backend to run, *how* to arrange your network, and *what* RLM Studio needs from you to talk to it. Each per-provider guide ([anthropic](anthropic.md), [openai](openai.md), [ollama](ollama.md), [lmstudio](lmstudio.md), [vllm](vllm.md), [dgx-spark](dgx-spark.md)) keeps the specifics.

## 1. Pick a backend

| If you want… | Use | Keyless? | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strongest reasoning + long context | Anthropic (Claude) | No (API key) | [anthropic.md](anthropic.md) |
| Broadest model selection, pay-per-use | OpenAI (GPT-4o) | No (API key) | [openai.md](openai.md) |
| Local quantized models, zero setup | Ollama | Yes | [ollama.md](ollama.md) |
| Local GUI-driven inference | LM Studio | Yes | [lmstudio.md](lmstudio.md) |
| High-throughput GPU serving (Linux) | vLLM | Yes (trusted network) | [vllm.md](vllm.md) |
| Self-hosted on Nvidia Grace Blackwell | DGX Spark (Ollama or vLLM) | Yes (trusted network) | [dgx-spark.md](dgx-spark.md) |

**Rule of thumb:** start cloud (OpenAI or Anthropic) unless you have a reason not to — cost, data residency, latency, or hardware you already own. Pick local backends when the network boundary matters more than the model quality.

## 2. Deployment topologies

RLMKit is two processes — the FastAPI backend (:8000) and the Next.js frontend (:3000). The LLM is a third process, which you can place anywhere you can route to.

### All-local

RLMKit, frontend, and the LLM (Ollama / LM Studio) all run on one machine. Simplest; bounded by the machine's RAM and GPU.

### Laptop + remote GPU host

RLMKit runs on your dev laptop; the LLM runs on a remote GPU box (DGX Spark, a workstation, a rented GPU). RLM Studio points at `http://<gpu-host-ip>:<port>`. This is the topology the DGX Spark guide explicitly supports — it keeps your development tools on the laptop and offloads inference to hardware that can handle it.

End-to-end health check for this topology:

```bash
# From the laptop
curl http://<gpu-host-ip>:11434/api/tags          # Ollama reachable?
curl http://localhost:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool   # RLMKit backend up?
```

### All-cloud

RLMKit runs locally; the LLM is a cloud API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). No networking to think about beyond the laptop's outbound connection. This is the default path for the two cloud guides.

### Self-hosted behind a VPN / SSH tunnel

Same shape as the remote-GPU-host topology, but the network boundary is a VPN or an SSH tunnel instead of a LAN. Bind the LLM to `127.0.0.1` on the host, forward the port through the tunnel, and RLM Studio points at `http://localhost:<forwarded-port>`. Safer than exposing a local backend over the open network.

## 3. What RLM Studio needs

Every LLM Provider in RLM Studio is four fields. Three are always required; one (API key) depends on the backend.

| Field | Meaning | Required? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Backend** | The adapter id — `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `vllm` | Always |
| **Model** | The model id the backend understands (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `llama3.1:8b`) | Always |
| **Base URL** | Override the backend's default endpoint. Leave blank to accept the default. | Optional — cloud backends default correctly |
| **API key** | Cloud backends only. Local backends (`ollama`, `lmstudio`, `vllm`) have no API-key field — secure them with a network boundary instead (see §5). | Cloud only |

**Test Connection** in Settings runs a live probe against the Base URL with your key. On success it records `last_tested_at`, `last_tested_by = "manual"`, and resets `consecutive_failures` to 0. On failure it reports the specific error (401, 429, connection refused, …) so you can diagnose without leaving Settings.

## 4. Configuration surfaces

Two surfaces can configure a provider:

- **Settings → LLM Providers** — runtime, UI-driven. Changes take effect immediately. Stored in the SecretStore (OS keyring when available, or `~/.rlmkit/api_keys.json` chmod 600).
- **`.env` and environment variables** — startup-only. Read once by pydantic-settings when the server boots.

**Precedence:** real environment variables → SecretStore (from the UI) → legacy `.env`. If you set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in both the UI and the shell, the shell value wins.

See `.env.example` for the full list of overrides (`RLMKIT_OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, …).

## 5. Security & network boundaries

- **Secret storage** is handled for you: cloud API keys go to the OS keyring where available, falling back to `~/.rlmkit/api_keys.json` with `chmod 600`. They are never logged, never returned in API responses, and masked in the UI after first save.
- **Local backends have no API-key field in Settings.** `vllm --api-key` and similar are intentionally not surfaced — for a local backend, the meaningful boundary is the network, not a shared secret. Prefer one of:
  - Bind the server to `127.0.0.1` and route RLM Studio to it through an SSH tunnel.
  - Put the server behind a VPN.
  - Run the server on a LAN you trust.
- **Cloud backends** always need a valid API key with billing on the account. There is no anonymous path.

## 6. Operational hygiene

### Scheduled connection testing

RLM Studio can re-test every configured provider on a timer. Configure the interval under **Settings → Providers** (`connection_test_interval_minutes`, 0–1440; 0 disables the daemon). Each cycle:

- Tests up to 5 providers in parallel.
- Uses a 10-second per-test timeout.
- Marks a provider **offline** only after 2 consecutive failures (to avoid flap).
- A **single manual test success** flips an offline provider back to connected immediately.

Each provider row in Settings shows `last_tested_at`, `last_tested_by` (`manual` vs `background`), and `consecutive_failures` so you can tell at a glance whether a provider is healthy.

### Watching cost and outcome classification

Every execution gets classified into one of `success`, `timeout`, `budget_exhausted`, `context_overflow`, `general_error`. Non-success outcomes are excluded from cost / latency / token aggregations on the Dashboard, so "average cost per query" reflects only the runs that actually produced an answer. See the [rlm-studio-guide Dashboard section](../rlm-studio-guide.md#dashboard) for details.

### When connections go stale

If a provider flips to **offline** and you think it shouldn't have, check:

1. The network path from the RLMKit backend to the base URL (`curl` the base URL directly).
2. Whether the key is still valid / has billing (`401` vs connection refused).
3. Whether the server process is actually up (`ss -lntp | grep <port>` on the host).
