## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RLMKit, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by emailing **i.am.goga@gmail.com** with the subject line `[SECURITY] RLMKit vulnerability report`.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- The potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

You should receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Security Considerations

RLMKit executes LLM-generated Python code and interacts with external APIs. The following areas are especially security-sensitive:

### Code Execution Sandbox

RLMKit's `PyReplEnv` executes Python code generated by LLMs. The sandbox layer restricts dangerous operations, but contributors should be especially careful when modifying `src/rlmkit/envs/` to avoid weakening these protections.

### API Keys and Credentials

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or secrets. Use `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`).
- The `.env.example` file documents required variables without exposing real values.
- Review PRs carefully for accidental credential exposure.

### Prompt Injection

Since RLMKit processes user-supplied content through LLMs, prompt injection is a relevant threat. When working on the RAG pipeline or controller loop, consider how adversarial input could manipulate LLM behavior.

### Dependency Security

- Dependencies are pinned via `uv.lock`.
- We encourage contributors to flag any known vulnerabilities in upstream packages.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately.
2. We confirm and assess severity.
3. We develop and test a fix.
4. We release the fix and credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity).
5. Public disclosure after the fix is available.
