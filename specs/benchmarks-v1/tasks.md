# Tasks — Reproducible benchmarks v1

Branch `feat/benchmarks-v1` after `feat/rebrand-rlm-studio` merges (may run in parallel with `feat/interop-official-rlm`; the `rlm_official` engine row is added when that lands). One commit per phase; CI green each time. Allowlist in `plan.md` §2 is binding. Apply defaults for OQ-1..3 in `spec.md` §6.

## Phase 0 — confirmations (no edits)
- [ ] T0.1 Read `src/rlmstudio/benchmark/{dataset,runner,report}.py` and `run_matrix_comparison.py`; confirm the slot-builder wiring in `server/dependencies.py` can be reused from the application layer without importing `server/`.
- [ ] T0.2 Pick and record dataset sources + licenses (Gutenberg, RFCs, gov reports, repo docs).

## Phase 1 — dataset
- [ ] T1.1 Extend `BenchmarkCase` + loader validation; tests.
- [ ] T1.2 Author `benchmarks/longdoc-v1.yaml` (≥12 cases across ~5K/50K/150K tokens; four task types; `sources:` block).

## Phase 2 — matrix driver + scoring
- [ ] T2.1 `benchmark/matrix_runner.py` (providers × engines → `MatrixSlotDTO`s; per-case budgets; trace metrics extraction in the application layer).
- [ ] T2.2 `benchmark/scoring.py` (exact/contains + judge via `LLMPort`, `judge_pointwise.yaml`); tests with fakes.

## Phase 3 — report + page
- [ ] T3.1 Markdown table + aggregates in `report.py`; marker-based `BENCHMARKS.md` regeneration; idempotency test.
- [ ] T3.2 `BENCHMARKS.md` skeleton (methodology, caveats, links) with markers.

## Phase 4 — CLI + CI
- [ ] T4.1 `rlm-studio bench` subcommand + `benchmarks/run_benchmark.py` wrapper; `--dry-run` with fakes.
- [ ] T4.2 CI `bench-smoke` step (2 cases × 2 engines, no network).

## Phase 5 — real run (owner)
- [ ] T5.1 Configure providers (env vars per `docs/hosts/`); run cloud ×2, local ×1, engines ×3–4, three reps for cloud; commit `benchmarks/results/<date>/` + regenerated `BENCHMARKS.md`; log total cost.

## Phase 6 — docs
- [ ] T6.1 README "Where RLM Studio shines" cites the table; `docs/rlm-studio-guide.md` "Reproducing the benchmarks"; CHANGELOG.

## Phase 7 — acceptance
- [ ] T7.1 AC-1..AC-4 from `spec.md`; record in `doc_internal/v1.0.0-rlm-studio/MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`.
