      Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight into
      chemical energy. Plants use chlorophyll, a green pigment found in chloroplasts,
      to absorb light energy. This energy drives the conversion of carbon dioxide
      and water into glucose and oxygen. The overall equation is:
      6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2.
      Photosynthesis occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions (in the
      thylakoid membranes) and the Calvin cycle (in the stroma).
    query: "What are the two stages of photosynthesis and where do they occur?"
    expected_answer: "The two stages are the light-dependent reactions (in the thylakoid membranes) and the Calvin cycle (in the stroma)."

      The Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, ended the Thirty Years' War in
      the Holy Roman Empire and the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch
      Republic. It established the principle of state sovereignty, meaning each
      state has exclusive authority over its territory. The treaty is often cited
      as the beginning of the modern international system of sovereign states.
    query: "What principle did the Treaty of Westphalia establish?"
    expected_answer: "The Treaty of Westphalia established the principle of state sovereignty."

      Microservices architecture decomposes an application into small, independent
      services that communicate over the network. Each service owns its data and
      business logic. Benefits include independent deployment, technology diversity,
      and fault isolation. However, microservices introduce complexity: distributed
      transactions, network latency, service discovery, and operational overhead.
      Monolithic architectures, by contrast, package everything into a single
      deployable unit. They are simpler to develop, test, and deploy initially,
      but become harder to scale and maintain as the codebase grows. Teams working
      on different features may conflict during merges, and a bug in one module
      can bring down the entire application. A hybrid approach uses a modular
      monolith: a single deployment unit with well-defined internal module
      boundaries, allowing migration to microservices later if needed.
    query: "Compare the trade-offs between microservices and monolithic architectures. When would a hybrid approach be appropriate?"
    expected_answer: "Microservices offer independent deployment, tech diversity, and fault isolation but add distributed complexity. Monoliths are simpler initially but scale poorly. A hybrid modular monolith provides clean boundaries within a single deployment, suitable when teams want modularity without full microservice overhead, allowing later migration if needed."

      Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and
      services. Central banks use monetary policy tools to manage inflation:
      raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which reduces
      spending and slows price increases. Conversely, lowering rates stimulates
      borrowing and spending. Quantitative easing (QE) involves central banks
      purchasing government bonds to increase the money supply and lower
      long-term interest rates. Critics argue QE inflates asset prices without
      proportionally benefiting the real economy. Supply-side inflation, caused
      by disruptions like pandemics or wars, is harder to address with monetary
      policy alone, as rate hikes may further reduce output without resolving
      supply constraints.
    query: "Why is supply-side inflation harder to manage with traditional monetary policy?"
    expected_answer: "Supply-side inflation stems from production disruptions rather than excess demand. Raising interest rates reduces demand but doesn't resolve supply constraints, and may further reduce economic output, making it a blunt tool for this type of inflation."

      Study A (2023): Examined 500 remote workers across tech companies.
      Found that fully remote workers reported 23% higher job satisfaction
      but 15% lower promotion rates compared to in-office peers. Productivity
      metrics (lines of code, tickets closed) showed no significant difference.
      Key concern: remote workers felt less visible to management.

      Study B (2023): Surveyed 1,200 managers across industries. 67% believed
      in-office workers were more productive, despite lacking quantitative evidence.
      42% of managers admitted to promotion bias favoring in-office employees.
      78% of companies planned to implement hybrid models by 2025.

      Study C (2024): Analyzed 3-year data from 50 companies that adopted hybrid
      models. Companies with structured hybrid schedules (e.g., 3 days office,
      2 days remote) saw 8% improvement in employee retention. Unstructured
      hybrid ("come in when you want") showed no retention benefit and increased
      scheduling conflicts. Productivity remained flat across all models when
      measured by output metrics rather than time-in-seat.

      Meta-analysis (2024): Combined data from 30 studies covering 15,000 workers.
      Concluded that work location has minimal impact on measurable productivity.
      The strongest predictor of remote work success was manager training in
      asynchronous communication and output-based evaluation.
    query: "Based on all studies, what is the most effective approach to remote/hybrid work, and what is the key success factor?"
    expected_answer: "Structured hybrid schedules (e.g., 3 days office, 2 days remote) are most effective, improving retention by 8% while maintaining productivity. The key success factor is manager training in asynchronous communication and output-based evaluation, which the meta-analysis identified as the strongest predictor of remote work success."
