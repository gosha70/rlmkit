// Two build modes:
//
// * Dev (`next dev`, `next build`): the Next server runs and proxies
//   `/api/*`, `/health`, `/ws/*` to the backend on :8000 via rewrites.
//   This is the path used by `npm run dev`, frontend CI, and any
//   developer who wants the UI on a separate port.
//
// * Bundle (`npm run build:bundle`, BUNDLE=1): produces a fully static
//   export under `frontend/out/`, intended to be copied into
//   `src/rlmstudio/_ui/` and served by FastAPI at `/studio` in the same
//   process as the API. No dev server, no rewrites — every request
//   is same-origin, so the rewrites are unnecessary.
//
// `basePath: "/studio"` makes Next emit asset URLs and client-side
// router paths under `/studio`, matching the FastAPI mount.
// `trailingSlash: true` produces one `index.html` per route directory,
// which is what FastAPI's `StaticFiles(html=True)` resolves cleanly.
