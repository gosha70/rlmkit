"""Diagnostics endpoint — powers the Learn tab persistent strip.

Returns four lightweight health checks (backend, provider, judge,
storage) so the client can render a status row on every Learn page.

Check semantics match the pitch's red-dot badge policy:
``error`` states are hard blockers (no LLM provider configured,
storage unreachable); ``warn`` is a soft issue (judge missing);
``ok`` passes. Only ``error`` drives the sidebar badge — see
``pitch-learn-tab.md`` §Diagnostics red-dot badge.
