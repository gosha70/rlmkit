feat: Initial RLMKit implementation - Week 1 Foundation (Days 1-4)

Implemented the execution foundation for RLMKit, a Recursive Language Model
toolkit for managing large context through code generation. This initial
release provides a safe, tested Python REPL environment with comprehensive
security sandboxing.

🎯 Core Features

Execution Environment (PyReplEnv):
- Python code execution with stdout/stderr capture
- Persistent global state across executions
- Exception handling and traceback capture
- Large content access via P variable
- Automatic output truncation
- Environment reset functionality

Security Sandbox:
- Safe mode with restricted builtins
- Import whitelist/blacklist mechanism
- Blocks dangerous operations (file I/O, subprocess, eval/exec)
- Allows safe modules (json, re, math, datetime, collections, etc.)
- Custom import whitelisting support
- Secure reset preserving security settings

🔒 Security Model

Safe Mode (Enabled):
✅ Safe builtins: print, len, sum, range, etc.
✅ Safe imports: json, re, math, datetime
✅ Data structures and comprehensions
✅ Lambda functions and decorators

❌ Blocked: open(), eval(), exec(), compile()
❌ Blocked: import os, sys, subprocess, socket, pathlib
❌ Blocked: exit(), quit(), breakpoint()

Unsafe Mode (Opt-in):
- Full Python access for trusted code
- No restrictions on imports or builtins

🚀 Development Status

Week 1: 80% Complete (4/5 days)
